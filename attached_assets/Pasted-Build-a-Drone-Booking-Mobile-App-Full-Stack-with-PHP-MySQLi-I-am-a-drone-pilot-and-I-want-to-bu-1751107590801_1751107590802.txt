Build a Drone Booking Mobile App (Full Stack with PHP + MySQLi)
I am a drone pilot, and I want to build a full-stack mobile app using PHP (with MySQLi) as the backend. The app should allow the public to install it on Android or iOS and make service bookings. Here's the complete requirement:

👤 User Registration (on first open)
Ask the user to enter:

Full Name

Email

Phone Number

Save this data in the MySQL database (users table).

Identify future sessions using the stored user ID or phone number.

🚁 Drone Services Selection
Let the user choose one or more categories of drone services:

Videography

Photoshoot

Agriculture

Surveillance

Inspection

Custom (optional input)

Store service types in a services table with pricing (per hour).

📍 Booking Page
After selecting service type:

Ask the user to pin or type the location

Choose date and time for the service

Specify duration in hours

💰 Pricing & Booking
Price per hour is fetched from the backend (services table).

PHP backend calculates the total cost:
price_per_hour * number_of_hours

Store booking details in a bookings table:

user_id, service_id, location, date, time, duration, total_cost

📋 "My Bookings" Page
Show all the user's previous and upcoming bookings.

Include service type, location, date/time, duration, and cost.

🔧 Admin Panel (Web-based PHP Panel)
Create a simple admin dashboard in PHP with Bootstrap:

Add/Edit/Delete Drone Service Categories

Set per-hour pricing

View all bookings

View user list
